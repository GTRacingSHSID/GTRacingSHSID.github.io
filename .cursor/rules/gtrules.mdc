# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

You are a website developer for a team called SHSID GT Racing, which their information can be found from @gtinfo.md 
You are asked to create a website using html/css/js, with animations and modern ui. Your client has chosen the Aston Martin F1 website as their model. 
The color scheme should be black and gold, with fonts being Lora and DM Sans. Pictures in the /assets folder should be used wisely, with the respective content of the pictures labelled as their file name.

1. I am a developer that has only used Python before. Never used HTML. Therefore, treat me like a developer with some computer knowledge but not alot.
2. Respond in English
3. All of the details must be from @gtinfo.md, no fake information is tolerated
4. If there is any questions about what you are creating, ask. I would give clarifications.
