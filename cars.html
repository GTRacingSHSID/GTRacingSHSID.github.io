                        <p data-i18n="car-design-desc1">Our drag racing car is built around a core principle: maximizing acceleration through intelligent weight reduction and precision engineering. By prioritizing lightweight materials like carbon fiber for the chassis, we achieve a balance between durability and minimal mass. The aerodynamic profile was refined to reduce drag, allowing the car to slice through the air with minimal resistance. Every design choice, from component placement to structural reinforcements, was guided by the goal of optimizing power-to-weight ratios while maintaining stability on straight-line tracks.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="car-design-desc2">To ensure agility, the suspension system was simplified and tuned for rapid weight transfer during acceleration. Strategic adjustments to ride height and tire alignment further enhance traction without compromising control. The focus remains on creating a streamlined machine capable of delivering explosive starts and consistent performance, even on short, high-intensity courses.</p>

                        <p data-i18n="car-components-desc1">The heart of the car lies in its meticulously selected components. Extensive testing led us to a high-efficiency brushed motor, chosen for its ability to deliver rapid torque while maintaining thermal stability. Paired with a reliable electronic speed controller (ESC), this setup ensures smooth power delivery from a lightweight NiMH battery, tailored for short bursts of energy. Tires underwent rigorous evaluation across surfaces, with a focus on maximizing grip on concrete—a critical factor in achieving faster launch times.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="car-components-desc2">Experiments with gear ratios and wheel sizes revealed how subtle adjustments impact acceleration and top speed. Through iterative trials, we identified configurations that minimize rotational inertia while maximizing torque transfer to the ground. While exploring innovative ideas like dual-motor systems, we ultimately prioritized simplicity, discovering that added complexity often introduced unintended trade-offs in weight and balance.</p>

                        <p data-i18n="car-performance-desc1">Every modification was driven by data. The suspension's spring stiffness and damping characteristics were fine-tuned to keep the car planted during acceleration, ensuring optimal tire contact. Tire compounds were upgraded to a specialized blend, offering superior grip under low-friction conditions without excessive wear. Even minor details, such as tire width and profile, were optimized to enlarge the contact patch for better traction.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="car-performance-desc2">By maintaining a relentless focus on weight reduction—eliminating non-essential parts and refining structural geometry—we achieved a lean, purpose-built machine. The result is a car that excels in delivering instantaneous acceleration, proving that strategic engineering and disciplined testing can unlock peak performance without compromising reliability.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="car-performance-desc3">This overview highlights our approach to innovation while safeguarding proprietary techniques.
