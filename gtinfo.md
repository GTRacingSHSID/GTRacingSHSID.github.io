## Page 3: Executive Summary
GT Racing (or Gran Turismo Racing) is a racing team founded in 2017, aiming to achieve even better results in this season’s competition and spread our influence in the RC community. With the results of achieving Global 3rd in the Ten 80 Racing Challenge last year in Charlotte, NC, we are a fully developed and organized club with elites from all fields, consisting of but not limited to experienced drivers who achieved top 1% globally in Virtual Racing, engineers who participated in a wide variety of global STEM competitions, and business experts with outstanding performances in global business competitions.  

As a group of international students all dedicated to different academic endeavors, it seems entirely unlikely that such a diverse group would be unified in a single, organized team. Nevertheless, we made it happen. What brought us together is our passion in achieving the ultimate goal, to create one of the best student-formed racing corporations in China.  

With greater goals comes a great need of resource and support. In the previous years, funding this costly project was certainly a difficult task. However, through our efforts and connections, we have solved this issue successfully with major improvements in 2023. By sharing a similar mission, vision, and value with our own team, we have been receiving sponsorships from real firms in various fields, such as蟹太太 and 易车鲨壳, two firms based on food and media respectively.  

In this 2024-2025 season, we spent over ¥10,000 innovating, maintaining, and improving our car design, as well as supporting our business. While this was certainly a massive upscale from last year's funds, we are well equipped with 3 strong, competent business managers that keep records of all expenses and make smart financial decisions.  

Besides being efficient with our funds, we also put an equal amount of effort in our branding, advertising, and social media coverage. Our team members are all experienced in facing questions from real business experts and are confident in expressing ourselves in presentations. We have not only given presentations in campus about our club but also lectures aimed at all age groups to achieve greater educational value.

## Page 5: Team History  
GT Racing continues the legacy of a team with the same name, one of the most prolific teams around the competition - Founded by team leader Zhang Gabriel Jia Xiao in 2017, GT Racing was a club in Shanghai High School International Division (SHSID). From the graduation of Gabriel Zhang, the team has once lost its advantage around the race, but under the hard work of our team members, who started from nothing, we managed to revive the glory of the team and achieve even higher accomplishments and successes than before.  

In the past, members of GT racing self-studied and referred to the teaching materials of High schools and Universities, as well as relevant experimental research topics and CAD design. As a result of these efforts, in the 2018 season, GT racing won the championship in China and won the single champion of aerodynamics in the 2018 US STEM NSL Cup finals.  

As a new team, we are far ahead in the competition. In the total score ranking, as a team participating for the first time, we also achieved a good record of seventh in the total score. In 2020, due to responsibility handover and the Covid-19, our team did not participate in the competition that corresponding year. In the 2021 NSL China Stop, we came back to the competition with a new generation of club members, winning various awards including and not limited to Pit stop challenge, fastest lap, and the superspeed track challenge. In that year, we achieved first place of all the racing events. In the 2022 NSL China Stop, we won second place overall with a small point difference and won over ten certificates for a variety of events that include both racing modules, STEM modules, art modules, and business modules. In the 2023 NSL China Stop, we won first place overall and dominated in many subcategories. In the 2024 NSL China Stop, due to mechanic failures, we only won 4th place. However, after refurbishing the car and training for the 2024 Ten 80 Racing Challenge in Charlotte, NC, we impressed the US teams and won an overall 3rd.  

**2025 Update**: In the 2025 NSL China Stop, GT Racing secured the **Overall Championship**, solidifying our position as a dominant force in RC racing.  

This year, with a team stronger and more dedicated, we already have plans to achieve better results. We attended the 2024 SIMARA Cup and won second overall. Moreover, we hosted our first tournament, the XTT Cup, at RCI in Shanghai. With a total of 4 teams attended, it is a great opportunity for us to test and reflect our strength going into NSL 2025. We are very confident going into this season's competition and will give it our very best.

## Page 7: Distinctive Features of Our Team  
As introduced, we are a club with a huge burden of carrying on the past accomplishments of our predecessors, yet we are confident, energetic, and dedicated to making this a reality and further extending that legacy. Ever since 2019 when the creators of the club went to college, the club nearly shut down and the advisor teacher quit as well, meaning the club was facing a huge dilemma. However, new, innovative members joined and, with zero budget and no useful materials from the beginning, managed to restart the club from near extinction and bring liveliness to RC cars in SHSID. These pioneers of STEM single-handedly made everything in our plan a feasible reality, and it's only right that we respect their mission and accomplishments and to make sure the club continues to stay in the spotlight rather than degrading once again. Therefore, we distinctly value the legacy that our club establishes for the future, always sustainably and constantly reforming, recruiting, reflecting, and educating each other, leaving as many resources as possible for the next generation of STEM enthusiasts who will continue bringing more success. We wish to craft a team with achievements and awards so that in the future, members can look back at our history with pride and honor.  

Our name, GT Racing, is a special acronym for two distinct team names that can be used alongside one another; GabrielTim racing and GranTurismo racing. As previously mentioned, Gabriel, alongside his friend Tim, were the founders of this long-lasting community of Racing enthusiasts, which is reflected in the name, serving as a reminder for members to never forget their mission of keeping the club's positive influence and growth. On the other hand, GranTurismo is the first modern racing game, intended to emulate the appearance and performance of a huge collection of real-world cars. It was revolutionary with its high-quality graphics and innovative goal to provide the experience of driving different cars as best as they can. It's attention to detail brought the digital racetrack to life, became the model for countless other racing games such as the Forza Horizon series, and overall, changed the experience of racing games for the better, earning an honorable reputation as one of the most influential games of the 21st century. GT Racing’s goals are no different than GranTurismo’s too. We expect and always work towards becoming a powerful source of inspiration for both the STEM and racing community, bringing countless people together and giving them a high-quality experience of many different fields like engineering, business, and computer science.  

Our Logo is also a distinct feature of our team, as it represents many of the strengths and aspirations of our team. Adopting a golden color and taking inspiration from a chariot, it represents power, using the horse to represent “horsepower” and the chariot to represent our car that harness that horsepower. It combines mechanical elements with nature, incorporating neo-classical Greek elements to symbolize the club’s achievements, its stability, and its esteemed tradition. Additionally, the design follows the mascot of our school, the SHSID stallions, showing our dedication to representing a greater community of STEM enthusiasts in anything we attend. Together, this logo shows our competitive spirit, the speed of our cars, and our dedication to building a network of RC teams.

## Page 10: Project Planning  
One of our existing goals is to amplify our influence both on campus and within the STEM & RC community. To reach that goal, we plan to both increase our popularity at school and elevate our influence on social media. Apart from updating our current WeChat Official Account and Bilibili channel, we have also started operating our Douyin account and sharing our STEM-related activities and achievements with the public. This will measurably enhance the impact of both our team and the whole STEM & RC community.  

To achieve the other goal, to prepare for the NSL 2025 China Stop in February, we have constructed comprehensive plans for different departments to increase our performance in the competition. The engineering department will optimize the race car by increasing its performance and durability, as well as preparing the gears and parts that will act as backups during the competition. The business department will be preparing business plans, presentations, elevator pitches, connecting with sponsors, publishing online content on social media, and taking care of the budget and financials. Designers will be designing our team's new logo, creating jerseys, posters, and decorations to improve the team's public image and prominence.

## Page 11: Team Structure  
Our team is divided into 3 main departments: The Engineering Department, the Business Department, and the Socials Department. Our team has achieved efficiency through our department system, and inter-departmental relationships have considerably improved our team's chemistry.  

The Engineering Department consists of two parts: the Racing Department and the Mechanics Department. The Racing Department is in charge of driving the vehicle during competition. The driver practices driving the car around the campus, and the instructor is responsible for providing assistance to the driver. The Mechanics department is in charge of changing the parts in the car, adding new parts, keeping the car in good quality, and fixing the car when it malfunctions. Due to the difficulty of its tasks and being one of the most essential departments in our team, the Mechanics department is one of the most time-consuming and money-consuming departments.  

In the Business Department, there is the Finance Department and the Public Relations Department. The Finance Department is in charge of overseeing all expenditures from the team, recording all transactions and constraining the budget for other departments. The Public Relations Department is in charge of writing the business plan, hosting promotion events in and out of campus, giving out presentations in competitions or to sponsors, and setting up stands during the competition.  

The Socials Department contains the Arts Department and the Writers Department. The Arts Department is in charge of creating the team logo, posters, jerseys, and stands. The Writers Department is in charge of writing articles that will be posted on the team Official Account.

## Page 12: Financials  
We allocate our funds in a cost-effective manner, focusing on various categories such as tool procurement, purchasing car components for modification, acquiring team jerseys, marketing expenses, and other associated fees. With increased funds at our disposal, we will enhance our existing race cars and allocate more resources towards the production and promotion of other aspects of the competition. Our goal is to utilize these funds to elevate the team's performance, enabling us to gain substantial achievements in the upcoming competition.

| **Total**                  |            | **25,350**   |  

The team has expanded its inventory to include five cars, six car shells, and ten batteries. Additionally, we possess a collection of basic tools and screws that facilitate the repair process. We are looking to purchase additional electric screwdrivers to enhance our performance during pit stops, which we identified as an area of weakness last year. Following a comprehensive evaluation of our cars that participated in races last year, we intend to perform necessary repairs, replace any malfunctioning parts, and upgrade components to improve handling and optimize power transfer from the motor to the wheels. Furthermore, as we have benefitted greatly from previous team's decisions to allocate their funds to the next generation, we plan to do the same, to support our new team consisting of rookies. This will involve the purchase of car upgrades, basic tools, and assistance with establishing their business department. To achieve the ideal conditions for success, this investment from our sponsors is essential for the development and growth of our team. We hope that our sponsors will be able to see the mutual benefits through this collaboration and we will create greater value together.

## Page 14: Opportunities to Support & Benefits  
### Support:  
As the club is secure in good hands, improving day by day, we are currently in need of funding from long term sponsors to help support our team’s progress and cover costs of annual spending such as changing of parts. This financial support would be mainly used to serve the purposes of purchasing necessary materials, team designs, and other technological expenses. We are looking for funding of 30,000RMB, as this fund will cover our budget in completing any club-related purchases. Any other support of related resources or social media promotions would also be highly appreciated.  

This funding would not only support our team but assist our mission to construct the community for students passionate about STEM subjects. It would provide value to the community of high school students as a whole and promote more people to be involved in STEM related completions as our influence grows.  

### Benefits to Investors:  
As a sponsor supporting GT Racing (2024-2025), you would certainly receive lots of benefits in return. These benefits come mainly in the form of a collaboration and promotion of your company. Promotions mostly includes:  

- Logos on jerseys, car shells, posters, booth decorations, etc.  
- Video promotions on social media (Douyin, Wechat video channel)  
- Article promotions on WeChat official account or even school official news account  
- Presentation promotions, held inside and outside of school.
